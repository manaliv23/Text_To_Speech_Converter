Text to speech is the technique of converting any text into voice. The text-to-speech project turns words on digital devices into audio using a simple button press or finger touch. The text-to-speech Python project can help persons who struggle with reading.

Project (Text to Speech in Python) Prerequisites To complete this project, we will employ the fundamental ideas of Python, Tkinter, gTTS, and playsound libraries.
1. Tkinter is a common GUI Python package that allows you to create GUI programs quickly and easily.
2. gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) is a Python module for converting text to audio.
3. The playsound module is used for playing audio files. This module allows us to play sounds.

Commands to install the pakages:
